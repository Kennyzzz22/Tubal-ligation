				<p><b> What is it? </b></p>
					<p> Tubal ligation is a type of surgical procedure that prevents pregnancy. Tubal refers to your fallopian tube while ligation means to tie off. It prevents the eggs from travelling to the fallopian tube. </p>

				<p><b> Types </b></p>
					<p><i> 1. Monopolar coagulation </i></p>
							<p> With the use of an electric current, the fallopian tube is cauterized (burned to stop bleeding or prevent infections). The same current is applied to further damage the rest of the tube. </p>
							
					<p><i> 2. Bipolar coagulation </i></p>
							<p> Similar with monopolar, an electric current runs through the fallopian tube to cauterize. However, this occurs in different sections typically 2-3 cm long. </p>
							
					<p><i> 3. Fimbriectomy </i></p>
							<p> A part of the fallopian tube that lies closest to the ovary is cut and removed. </p>
					
					<p><i> 4. Tubal ring </i></p>
							<p> A silicone band is placed over the doubled portion of the fallopian tubes. </p>
							
					<p><i> 5. Tubal clip </i></p>
							<p> A permanent clip is fastened to the doubled portion of the tubes similar to the tubal ring procedure. </p>
							
					<p><i> 6. Irving procedure </i></p>							<p> Before the section between the tubes is removed, two sutures are placed. Each ends of the tubes are then placed to the back of the uterus and connective tissues. </p>	
					
					<p><i> 7. Pomeroy tubal ligation </i></p>
							<p> Being the most common type of tubal ligation, the procedure involves doubling a portion of the tube then placing a suture. The remaining ends are then cauterized using an electrical current </p>
				<p> </p>			
				<p><b> Procedure </b></p>
					<p> a. You will get anaesthesia for you to not feel anything during the procedure. </p>
					
					<p> b. The procedure will be done through an incision in the abdomen or through the vagina, and will be performed using various techniques including clips, rings, or cautery. A small device (laparoscope) is inserted through the incision. </p>

					<p> c. After the surgery, the surgeon will stitch the incision. </p>
					
				<p> </p>	
			   <p><b> Effectivity </b></p>
					<p> It has a 99.5% effectivity rate which means there is only a slight risk of becoming pregnant after the procedure. It is highly uncommon for the tubes to fuse back together, the failure rate is only 0.5%.
				
				<p> </p>	
			   <p><b> Risks & Side effects </b></p>
					<p> Life-threatening issues after the procedures are generally rare; however, it the woman is advised to immediately call her doctor when you:</p>
					
						<p> a. have a fever; </p>
						<p> b. develop rashes, swelling, or troubles in breathing; </p>
						<p> c. feel intense and seemingly constant belly pain; </p>
						<p> d. have unusual and/or foul-smelling vaginal discharge; </p>

				<p> </p>	
			   <p><b> Cost </b></p>

				<p><b> Is it reversible? </b></p>
					<p> Not all types of tubal ligation is reversible. Tubal ligation reversal (also called tubal sterilization or tubal reanastomosis) can be done considering multiple factors; likelihood of success depend upon: </p>

						<p> 1. Age </p>
						<p> 2. Infertility causes such as irregular periods, uterine fibroids, and endometriosis </p>
